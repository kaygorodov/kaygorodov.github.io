Summary: reached.

Actually, I completed my 50th problem on Feb 12th more than two weeks ago. But then, I went to the Netherlands. So, due to the lack of time, I am only now writing this post.

My next target will be to become a blue one on TopCoder. From this point onwards, I am going to regularly participate in TopCoder's SRMs.
