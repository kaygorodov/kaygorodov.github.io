Summary: I recently set a goal for myself to solve fifty SPOJ classical problems.

Some little time ago, I decided to start participating in topcoder competitions (SRM). But the list of programming languages which you can use during those competitions is very short. For now, you can use C++, C#, Java, VB and Python. Because from that list, I only know Python and a little Java, I chose Java. My opinion is that python does not fit well for algorithm competitions. The other thing is that I program by using Scala; therefore, it does not hurt to know Java better.

Of course, it would be great if Scala was in that list. But unfortunately it is not. So, to become more familiar with Java and its standart library, I decided to train myself by solving first fifty problems on SPOJ website sorted in [that order](http://www.spoj.com/problems/classical/sort=6).

At the time of writing this post, I have already solved 44 problems. It took 12 days. Of course, I did not practice all time because of my job and family. Additionally, I have learned several classical algorithms that I did not know before. By the way, it is [my SPOJ record](http://www.spoj.com/status/kaygorodov/signedlist/).

I like SPOJ, it is a nice resource in terms of the number and quality of problems. Whether you are preparing for a technical interview or just honing your coding skills, SPOJ is a nice place to practice. The only sad thing is SPOJâ€™s obsolete and inconvenient UI.

At the end, I want to wish myself to solve the six left problems soon.
