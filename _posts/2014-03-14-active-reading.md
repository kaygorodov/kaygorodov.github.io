title: Active Reading, Part I
---

I am reading a book that has a couple of chapters devoted to active reading, so I decided to start writing a set of posts about this topic.

At first, I want to write a little about the book. This book is about preparation for the TOEFL exam. There is a reading section in this exam. Because time is restricted, you have to read and comprehend a lot of information in order to answer questions right. The authors of the books suggest to use active reading.

I have not learned a lot about active reading, but I want to share what I know so far. Because the articles on the exam are academic ones, it means that they are well organized and structured. A regular article consists of an introduction, a few body paragraphs and a conclusion. It gives some benefits to a reader.

Active reading is about how to analyze texts right as well as about where you should pay maximum of attention and where you should just skim. Additionally, active reading encourages you to map out the text. This plan helps you find information in the text very quickly when you answer a particular question.

It is just some introduction, and I continue describing active reading in the next blog posts. I am very interested in active reading because we could apply it not only for exam but for a lot of other cases too.
