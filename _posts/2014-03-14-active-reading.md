title: Active Reading, Part I
---

I am reading a book that has a couple chapters devoted to active reading, so I decided to start writing a set of posts about this topic.

At first, I want to write a little about the book. This book is about preparation to the TOEFL exam. There is a reading section in this exam. Because time is restricted, you have to read and comprehend a lot of information in order to answer questions right. The authors of the books suggest to use active reading.

I have not learnt a lot about active reading, but I want to share what I knew so far. Because the articles on exam are academic ones, it means that they are well organized and structured. A regular article consists of an introduction, a few body paragraph and a conclusion. It gives some benefits to a reader.

Active reading is about how to analyze texts right as well as about where you should pay maximum of your attention and where you should just skim. Additionally, active reading encourages you map out the text. (I mean here that It encourages to create some plan/outline of texts). This plan helps you find information in the text very quickly when you answer a particular question.

It is just some introduction, and I continue describing active reading in the next blog posts. I am very interested in active reading because we could apply it not for only exam but for a lot of other cases too.
