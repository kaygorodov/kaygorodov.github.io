title: Crafting an Effective Writer. The Coursera Course
---

I am taking a coursera course devoted to english writing, and I am really excited about it.

I’ve learnt a lot about writing. There are grammar rules, writing techniques and steps of building writing process. I used to think that writing is like a some mysterious thing, like you connect to some astral and transmit the received data to paper. Studying this course, I knew that writing is hard work, but on the other hand, it is a very good investigated process. It is like some science. We have the techniques, tricks and best practices. This theory describes us how to organize writing process and develop writing abilities.

There are a few reasons why I am taking the course. I really want to improve my writing abilities because my profession needs at least basic writing skills. Additionally, I am going to take the TOEFL test.

I am looking forward to ending this course. I’ve already done last assignment and just waiting when peers will assess me.

Study english! Good luck!
